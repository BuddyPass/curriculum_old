#Adding the Search Function

The last piece of this project is adding the search functionality. 

Exercise: Walk students through what this actually means. (All they are doing is making the tag argument in the query URL a variable that is pulled from a form in the HTML).

Step 1: Make a form in the HTML

Step 2: Pull the contents of the form into a variable in the JavaScript.

Step 3: Assign that variable to the tag argument in the query URL.

#Debugging and Personalization

Some gotchas that may come up: clearing the map between searches, opening and closing info windows. 

Ideas for personalization: 
- Improve the design of the page
- Use thumbnails of the photos as markers instead of the default Google marker
- Limit the photos searched for and shown to a specific area
- Read the documentation for the APIs and come up with ideas of your own!
